## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Frontend JavaScript library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor
- [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) - CSS methodology
- Mobile-first Workflow

### Useful resources

- [Sass Masterclass - Rocketseat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaI8dHUthLA) - This masterclass helped understand @mixins, @include, @extends, etc. Sass features to avoid repetition and improve the project organization. Will keep using them going forward
